Background

The study and use of numerical analysis to address physics-related issues is known as computational physics. Computational physics, which is now a subset of computational science, was historically the first scientific field in which modern computers were used. Some people think of it as a branch or subfield of theoretical physics, while others see it as a study field that complements both theory and experiment.

In the task given, which we are to solve numerically the time-independent schrodinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional potential well requires the knowledge and skills of computational physics
